## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Master HTML5 semantic elements and accessibility
- Advance CSS skills including Flexbox, Grid, and animations
- Build interactive web applications with JavaScript
- Learn modern frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
- Implement responsive design principles
- Practice version control with Git and GitHub
- Explore build tools and development workflows

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project is self-contained with its own setup instructions. Navigate to individual project folders to explore:

```bash
cd project-06
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📝 Development Workflow

### Making Project-Specific Commits

This monorepo is designed to track changes per project. When working on a specific project:

#### Method 1: Manual Project-Specific Commits
```bash
# Make changes to your project (e.g., project-06)
# Add only the specific project files
git add project-06/

# Commit with project-specific message
git commit -m "project-06: Your commit message here"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

#### Method 2: Use the Helper Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Use the commit helper script
./commit-project.sh project-06 "Add new navbar feature"

# This will:
# - Show you what files are changed
# - Add only project-06 files to staging
# - Create a properly formatted commit message
# - Ask for confirmation before committing
```

### Helper Script Usage
```bash
./commit-project.sh <project-name> "<commit-message>"

# Examples:
./commit-project.sh project-06 "Add responsive design"
./commit-project.sh project-1 "Fix CSS styling issues"
./commit-project.sh project-5 "Update JavaScript functionality"
```

### Benefits of This Approach
- ✅ Clean, project-focused commit history
- ✅ Easy to track changes per project
- ✅ Perfect for showcasing individual project evolution
- ✅ Maintains monorepo structure with organized commits

## 📈 Progress Timeline

- **July 2024**: Started with HTML/CSS basics (projects 1-3)
- **August 2024**: Added JavaScript interactivity (projects 4-5)
- **October 2024**: Began React development (project-06)
- **Future**: Planning Vue.js, Angular, and full-stack projects
